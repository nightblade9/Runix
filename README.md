Runix wouldn't exist without [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), which showed me what a fantastic game editor can look like.

Runix is built on the shoulders of giants, including (but not exhaustively) these amazing libraries:

- [IGuina](https://github.com/RonenNess/Iguina)
- [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame)
- [MonoGo](https://github.com/MonoGo-Engine/MonoGo)
- [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)
